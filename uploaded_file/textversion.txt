Pre requis ite  Fo rm U TD requires each student to verify that they have had the prerequisites for this class.   In order  to facilitate  this process, a modifiable PDF file has been placed on eLearning that asks you to  explicitly state that you have had the prerequisites.  You should download that file, fill it out, and  upload it into the “Prerequisite Verification” entry in the “Assignments” folder on  eLearning.  Note that this is a requirement and must be completed within the first two weeks of  the semester.   Failure to do so will result in loss of 20 points on your final accumulated  homework points.  Y ou may “sign” this file by typing your name in the appropriate box.   However, please be aware  that the authentication for this signature is derived from your login credentials on eLearning. Do  not allow anyone else to fill out or upload this document for you.
