Welcome to  Fall 202 2 Syllabus My name is Kamran Z.  Khan, and I will be your instructor for this course. I am looking forward to a  terrific semester with you. This is not a self - paced course -- it's important that you keep on top of the weekly reading and  assignments! Each of you must manage your own time  each week to know when assignments, and any other  weekly course obligations, are due. This will involve regularly logging into eLearning to check  discussion forums and communications, monitoring your UTD email address, and virtually interacting  with classm ates, team members, instructors, and course materials. At this point, I suggest the following actions:  ✓ Log into eLearning and begin to familiarize yourself with the course site ✓ Make sure you've confirmed your email address in the eLearning system so y ou can receive  messages and announcements  via  eLearning ✓ Read through the Syllabus so you know the rhythm of course, and what is expected.  ✓ Please post your specific questions about the class in the Getting Started forum  ✓ Take Quiz 1  available under  Quizzes and Exams at eLearning  – due by August  28 th I look forward to working with you this semester and getting off to a strong start!

Students should immediately report any problems to the instructor and also contact the  online  eLearning Help Desk . The instructor and the eLearning Help Desk will work with the student to resolve  any issues at the earliest possible time.  An exam should not be missed except for the most extreme circumstances (such as hospitalization or  death of an immediate family  member). If you miss an exam, you must have documentation for the  absence. A make - up exam may be given to students with valid documentation. The allowance of a  make - up exam is at the sole discretion of the instructor. Grading Policy: Exams: 50% ( 2  midterm and 1 final exam ) Assignment s:  In Class , Quizzes, Homework & Project Average: 50% In Class assignments require class interaction and cannot be made up Departmental Attendance Policy: The Computer Science Department has implemented the  following attendance policy beginning Fall 2016: If a student misses three consecutive classes, the  student will receive a letter grade reduction to his or her final grade. This deduction is cumulative,  so  if a student misses three consecutive classes twice, the final grade will be reduced by two letter  grades. If a student misses four consecutive classes, the student will automatically receive an F for his  or her final grade.  Grading Scale: 98 - 100 A+  88 - 89 B+  78 - 79 C+  68 - 69 D+  Below 60 F  92 - 97 A  82 - 87 B  72 - 77 C  62 - 67 D  90 - 91 A - 80 - 81 B - 70 - 71 C - 60 - 61 D Classroom  Citizenship The instructor encourages students to take active part in class discussions. No  question is too simple/stupid to be asked. So, do not hesitate. Comet Creed This creed was voted on by the UT Dallas student body in 2014. It is a standard  that Comets choose to live by and encourage others to do the same: “As a Comet, I pledge honesty, integrity, and service in  all that I do.” UT Dallas Syllabus  Policies and  Procedures The information contained in the following link constitutes the University’s  policies and procedures segment of the course syllabus.
